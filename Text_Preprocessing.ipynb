Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made.

of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. as the story unfolds in real life and fiction, sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. the screenplay was probably the worst part about it. it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. the second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. he has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. he switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. the actual book in the film that's titled \\\"the number 23\\\" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. when carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. at this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston. overall, the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. rating 3/10\",\n          \"i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did. the anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself \\\"where i have i seen them before?\\\" forget the running time listed on new line's tape, this ain't no 103 minutes, according to my vcr timer and imdb. space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.\",\n          \"caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason, while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield. ty webb is funny, being the only character from the original. most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (henry wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt, being played by randy quaid. every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (i don't go in for law suits or motions. i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. and then i'm comin' upstairs junior, and i'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a**! do we have an understanding?). offsetting his small role however, is dan acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for bill murray. his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. overall caddyshack ii is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number 23 as the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually endthe number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just didnt know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time the second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awfuljoel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that hes still capable of making a stinker he has the movie drenched in style but he just cant get a good focus he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace he switches from reality to whats actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying the actual book in the film thats titled the number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears when carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery at this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach its horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finishedthe acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didnt even seem to be trying he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston overall the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills rating 310\",\n          \"i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did the anthology stories were better than par but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself where i have i seen them before forget the running time listed on new lines tape this aint no 103 minutes according to my vcr timer and imdb space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8\",\n          \"caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield ty webb is funny being the only character from the original most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original henry wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt being played by randy quaid every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office i dont go in for law suits or motions i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a fing baseball bat make a bonfire with the chippindalemaybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it and then im comin upstairs junior and im grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a do we have an understanding offsetting his small role however is dan acroyd who is obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny its just stupid overall caddyshack ii is a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it\"\n        ],\n
